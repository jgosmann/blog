There are [complete blogs devoted to the quirks of
MATLAB](http://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/). Anyways, here is another post on
the topic and how some minor quirks produce a hard to find bug. Look at the
following code:

```matlab
rand(rngStreams{obj.rngId}, 2, 1)
```

<!--more-->

It is supposed to produce two random numbers generated from a random number
generation stream which has been initialized with a specific seed (to always get
the same sequence). However, when debugging this code I realized that the
numbers were generated from the default stream and not
`rngStreams{rngId}`. Thus, effectively ignoring the seed used for
initialization. Can you spot what may cause the problem?

Here it comes: Someone forgot to initialize `obj.rngId`. As it is
declared as a property on an object there is no warning and the property gets
initialized with a default value. So far I consider this an acceptable behavior.
However, the default value is an empty matrix `[]` and this leads to
some funny behavior together with the cell array `rngStreams`.

If you use an empty array to index a cell array, MATLAB will return
â€¦ *nothing*?! Not `null`, `none`, `nil`
or an empty cell array, but just nothing. And with nothing the code snippet
above becomes:

```matlab
rand(2, 1)
```

And that's the latest point in time where an error should be produced.
Obviously, the writer of the code intended to call the function with three
arguments. But whatever, if one of the arguments goes just missing what harm
does it do? We just leave the program producing the wrong random numbers and the
user thinking everything's fine!

The sad thing is that this kind of behavior with MATLAB is not a one time
experience for me. I stumble again and again over similar behavior where some
code seems to be working but is not. Moreover, all of these problems could be
prevented without loss if MATLAB was stricter on the number of arguments passed
to a function and types (i.e. returning an empty cell array instead of nothing).

Unfortunately it is not. So, use Python or R or whatever. But no MATLAB!
