I already wrote</Link> I gained a lot of knew experiences the last days during
the IK.  Especially with regard to making the decision for a Master program.
During all the thoughts about what I want to do later I came to an insight that
I have not seen in any advising text.

Often you are advised to study something which you like and in which you are
interested, instead of looking for job possibilities and the income. I agree
with this. However, the question is not just in what you are interested, but
also **how** you are interested in it!

What is my point? Maybe it gets a bit clearer with an example: I am interested
in many of the results of behavioral science. Nevertheless, I am not studying
behavioral science, because I am not really interested in the work to get these
results. The imagination to watch animals for hours and making detailed notes
meanwhile seems not very attractive to me.

Therefore it is a difference whether you are interested in the results in an
area of research or in doing the research yourself. This does not only apply to
the research, but of course to all sorts of activities and jobs. (For example
the process of programming is a activity where the process of doing it myself is
interesting and makes fun&nbsp;&ndash; not just the final program.)

I suppose the great art is to get the balance between these to areas right. That
means finding a job where you are interested in the results and the interest
will motivate you. At the same time the path of getting there should also be
interesting. Even if a more boring path can be endured for a motivating goal and
also the other way round it seems to me important to keep both in mind. At the
moment I am trying to figure out how much and in which way I am interested in
different things.
