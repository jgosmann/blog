The last week was very exciting and I don't really know where to begin. I was at
the [Interdisciplinary College (IK)](https://interdisciplinary-college.org/), a spring
school with courses from the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Neuro Biology,
Psychology, Cognitive Sciences and some other. This year's focus theme was
"Play, Act and Learn". The event was placed in the Heinrich-Lübke-Haus in Günne
at Lake Möhne.

You could chose from a little bit more
than 24 courses. Most of the courses consisted out of four sessions, each
with a duration of 90 minutes. Therefore, one could attend about fife courses
completely. Typically four courses were in parallel. However, the sessions of
some courses were not always in parallel with the same three courses. This made
the course selection not very easy. But you could check out also more courses
and areas of research. Now I am better informed what you are doing in
Computational Neuroscience or in the area of artificial intelligence in computer
games. That will help me probably a lot with my decision for a Master program.

One talk which should be mentioned is Entertainment Computing by Don Marinelli.
This person should be known by everyone who has seen [Randy Pausch's Last
Lecture](http://www.etc.cmu.edu/people/faculty/index.php). Actually, he is
a drama professor and the course was as expected very entertaining. Anyway, the
content was not that much and it was mostly an advertising for his Entertainment
Technology Center (ETC).

Another good and funny course was done by [Justin
London](http://www.people.carleton.edu/~jlondon/) about The Rules of the Game:
Cognitive Constraints on Musical Virtuosity and Musical Humor. Unfortunately,
I only saw the last session.

Not less important than the courses was the social interaction. Within a few
days I got to a whole lot of interesting people. But also got to know some
fellow students, with whom I did not had much to do yet, better. It was very
interesting to meet many Master and PhD students. You could also talk to most of
the speakers. (To exchange some words with Don Marinelli was great!)

There was a whole lot of possibilities to have some fun with the other
participants in your free time. For example there was a skittle alley for free
use, table tennis tables, a billiard table (however, without the black eight,
but with three threes) and a swimming pool that could be used nearly at every
time. Some of the participants played each night water ball. The bar where
a bottle of beer costs just an Euro was also often frequently visited. The only
disadvantage was that this resulted in few hours of sleep. But sleeping can be
done after the IK! (If you are really to tired just skip the breakfast and the
first course in the morning.)

Not to forget the food: This was not just incredible, but also very rich. There
were practically three meals each day: It began with breakfast, followed by
a coffee break after the first talk, continued with the lunch, another break
with cake and ended with dinner for the time being. Some hours after the dinner
they served some snacks in the bar.

Accordingly, the suprise dinner was very good at Tuesday. There you could wear
fine clothes. Anyways, the width of closing styles was that wide (from a simple
t-shirt to a suit) that you could hardly be over or under dressed. Afterward we
were presented a colorful program with music, an impressive juggling performance
by twins and several other performances. The Power Point karaoke, where
lecturers had to do talks to unknown slides without preparation, was very funny
as well.

Probably I did not mention quite all of the stuff I could tell about the IK2010.
Nevertheless, I hope I gave some impressions. I had a lot of fun and will come
back in the next year if it is somehow possible. The focus theme will than be
"Decisions, Consciousness and Free Will".
