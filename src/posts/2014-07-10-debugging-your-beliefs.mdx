There is actually a lot to discover in this short statement and it even
touches social issues. But for starters, let us take a look how bugs in computer
programs come about.

# How bugs are made

I think, there are at least two main reasons why bugs in computer programs
occur. Sometimes the programmer just mistypes something. By double checking the
code this is usually easy to find.

A second type of bug, however, is much harder to locate. It is the result of
implicit assumptions made by the programmer. When programming you make every now
and then an assumption how a programming language behaves or what a certain
function call does without even being aware of this in that moment. As long as
these assumptions are correct everything is fine.  But when relying on a wrong
assumption things might go awry.

I have a recent example of my own (which can be skipped over if you are not keen
on programming itself). I wanted to create a list of `size` empty lists for
which I wrote the following Python code:

```python
[[]] * size
```

Can you spot my assumptions here? I am assuming a new list instance will be
created when replicating `[]` and, thus, that all lists contained in the outer
list will be different instances which can changed individually. However, a list
containing a single list instance will be created first and then the reference
to that same instance gets replicated. Thus, modifying one of the inner lists
will modify all of them.

# How bugs are found

How does one find such bugs? Essentially, it is necessary become aware of
implicit beliefs and verify that they are correct. Once I realized what
assumptions I was making in the example above it was easy to verify that the
code does not produce independent list instances. Fixing the bug was then
a matter of seconds. The hard part is to achieve awareness of implicit
assumptions. It all comes down to the question: How do you become consciousness
of something unconsciousness?

Sometimes another person can be of help. That person will have another set of
presumptions and can therefore be able to spot such bugs more easily. This is
a good reason to do code reviews and/or pair programming.

But what if you are on your own? In that case, I do not know.

Part of it is probably experience and practice. But I wonder: Are there methods
to train becoming aware of implicit assumptions?

# Why does it matter to non-programmers?

Implicit beliefs do not only exist in programming. They are part of our everyday
life. Everyone has some assumptions about the persons he or she meets without
even being aware of it. Nevertheless, they influence how we interact with each
other. Teaching people about uncovering their implicit assumptions might have
the potential to make the world a better and fairer place.
